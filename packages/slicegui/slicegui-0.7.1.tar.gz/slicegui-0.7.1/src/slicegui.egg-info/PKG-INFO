        ## About
        
        Slice is an open-source, cross-platform GUI app that generates fonts with custom design sub-spaces from variable font inputs.
        
        ## Install
        
        * macOS: [Slice.0.7.1.dmg](https://github.com/source-foundry/Slice/releases/download/v0.7.1/Slice.0.7.1.dmg)
        * Windows: [Slice-0.7.1-Installer.exe](https://github.com/source-foundry/Slice/releases/download/v0.7.1/Slice-0.7.1-Installer.exe)
        
        Please see the [Installation docs](https://slice-gui.netlify.app/docs/install/) for additional details, including available package manager installation/upgrade approaches.
        
        ## User documentation
        
        User docs are available at https://slice-gui.netlify.app/docs/
        
        - [Installation](https://slice-gui.netlify.app/docs/install/)
        - [Usage](https://slice-gui.netlify.app/docs/usage/)
        
        ## Axis definitions
        
        Slice currently supports combinations of the following axis definition types in output fonts:
        
        - Fixed instance locations
        - Level 3 restricted axis ranges (must include original axis default value in the new, smaller axis range)<sup>[[1](#footnote1)]</sup>
        - Full, original variable axis ranges
        
        Define your font axes with the syntax in the table below.
        
        |Axis definition | Axis Editor Syntax  | Example |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | Fixed axis location| Integer or float value | `400.0` |
        | Restricted axis range | Colon-delimited min:max integer or float range | `200:700` |
        | Full axis range | Leave editor row blank | n/a |

        ## Acknowledgments
        
        ❤️ Slice slices with the fantastic [fonttools Python library](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools).
        
        ❤️ Slice uses the wonderful [Recursive](https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive) (sliced with Slice!) and [IBM Plex](https://github.com/IBM/plex) typefaces in the UI.

        <small><a id="footnote1">1</a>: Default axis locations are required to compile valid variable font format files.  The default axis value defined in the original font must be included in the restricted axis range due to the lack of compiler support for default axis location moves during the slicing process. We intend to support default axis location moves when it is possible to do so. [This issue is being tracked on our GitHub tracker](https://github.com/source-foundry/Slice/issues/32).</small>
