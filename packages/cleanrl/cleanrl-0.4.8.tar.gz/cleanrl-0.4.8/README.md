CleanRL is a Deep Reinforcement Learning library that provides high-quality single-file implementation with research-friendly features. The implementation is clean and simple, yet we can scale it to run thousands of experiments using AWS Batch. The highlight features of CleanRL are:

<!-- At the same time, CleanRL tries to supply many research-friendly features such as cloud experiment management, support for continuous and discrete observation and action spaces, video recording of the game play, etc. These features will be very helpful for doing research, especially the video recording feature that *allows you to visually inspect the agents' behavior at various stages of the training*. -->



* ðŸ“œ Single-file implementation
   * *Every detail about an algorithm is put into the algorithm's own file.* It is therefore easier to fully understand an algorithm and do research with.
* ðŸ“Š Benchmarked Implementation (7+ algorithms and 34+ games at https://benchmark.cleanrl.dev)
* ðŸ“ˆ Tensorboard Logging
* ðŸª› Local Reproducibility via Seeding
* ðŸŽ® Videos of Gameplay Capturing
* ðŸ§« Experiment Management with [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site)
* ðŸ’¸ Cloud Integration with docker and AWS 

Good luck have fun :rocket:

## Algorithms Implemented
- [x] Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
    * [dqn.py](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/blob/master/cleanrl/dqn.py)

## Get started

To run experiments locally, give the following a try:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl.git && cd cleanrl
# we strongly recommend to use `venv` to manage dependencies
# this will make the experiment much more reproducible!
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install cleanrl
python cleanrl/ppo.py \
    --seed 1 \
    --gym-id CartPole-v0 \
    --total-timesteps 50000 \
# open another temrminal and enter `cd cleanrl/cleanrl`
tensorboard --logdir runs
```

To use wandb integration, sign up an account at https://wandb.com and copy the API key. Then run

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
wandb login # only required for the first time
python cleanrl/ppo.py \
    --seed 1 \
    --gym-id CartPole-v0 \
    --total-timesteps 50000 \
    --prod-mode \
    --wandb-project-name cleanrltest
```


# Run RL experiments in various game environments

The following instructions assume linux environements. We first install the dependencies:

```bash
# install atari, pybullet, procgen, box2d, pettingzoo
source venv/bin/activate
pip install cleanrl[all]
# if you are using zsh, you will need to do 
# `pip install cleanrl\[all\]`


# install mujoco
curl -OL https://www.roboti.us/download/mujoco200_linux.zip
unzip mujoco200_linux.zip -d ~/mujoco/
mv ~/mujoco/mujoco200_linux ~/mujoco/mujoco200
unzip mujoco200_linux.zip -d ~/mujoco/
rm mujoco200_linux.zip
pip install gym[mujoco]
```

Now we can run the experiments:
```
source venv/bin/activate
cd cleanrl
# atari
python dqn_atari_visual.py --gym-id BeamRiderNoFrameskip-v4 
# pybullet
python td3_continuous_action.py --gym-id MinitaurBulletDuckEnv-v0
# procgen
python ppo_procgen_fast.py --gym-id starpilot
# box2d
python experiments/ppo_car_racing.py
# pettingzoo
python ppo_pettingzoo.py
```


## Open RL Benchmark

[Open RL Benchmark](https://wandb.ai/cleanrl/cleanrl.benchmark/reports/Open-RL-Benchmark-0-5-0---Vmlldzo0MDcxOA) by [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) is a comprehensive, interactive and reproducible benchmark of deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. It uses Weights and Biases to keep track of the experiment data of popular deep RL algorithms (e.g. DQN, PPO, DDPG, TD3) in a variety of games (e.g. Atari, Mujoco, PyBullet, Procgen, Griddly, MicroRTS). The experiment data includes:

- reproducibility info:
