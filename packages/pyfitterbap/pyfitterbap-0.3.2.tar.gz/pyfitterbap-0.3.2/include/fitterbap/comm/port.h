 * @brief The port API, used by the transport layer to interact
 *      with (potentially) dynamically instantiated ports.
 *
 * This structure defines a "class" in C with virtual function
 * callbacks, initialize, finalize, on_event, and on_recv.
 * The port factory function used to construct this instance normally
 * populates the callback fields and the meta field.
 *
 * The caller of the factory function, usually the communication stack, then
 * populates the other fields: pubsub, topic_prefix, transport, port_id,
 * and evm before calling initialize().
 *
 * The factory instance will often define its own internal
 * structure.  This API struct can be the first field, which
 * allows the callbacks to recast API instances to the
 * internal structure type.  Alternatively, it can use FBP_CONTAINER_OF
 * if the API structure is not the first field.
