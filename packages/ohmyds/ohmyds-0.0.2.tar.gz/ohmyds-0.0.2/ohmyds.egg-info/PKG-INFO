Description: # oh-my-ds
        Python library to pretty print data structures
        
        # Installation
        
        ```python3
        pip3 install ohmyds
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        Right now only binary tree is supported
        
        ```python3
        
        from ohmyds import binary_tree
        
        root = binary_tree.create_tree([1,2,3,4,None,5,None,6,7,8])
        ```
        
        For binary tree, you can do two operations right now - level order traversal and print
        
        ```python3
        print(root)
        ```
        
        The above command will print binary tree in a beautiful way (beauty is in the eyes of the beholder!)
        
        ```
         _1    
        /  \   
        3  2_  
         \   \ 
         5   4 
            / \
            7 6
        ```
