        ## How to install:
        
        You can install with PyPi from your command terminal: 
        >*pip install GIFgraph*
        
        ## How To Use:
        GIFgraph is a simple libary to help create animated data driven visuals. 
        
        The library was created and imagined to be used within single cells as part of a data science/ analytics solution and therefore works best in conjunction with Jupyter notebooks.
        
        Version 0.1.0 includes support for four types of chart: scatter (GG_scatter), pie (GG_pie), bar (GG_bar), and line (GG_line). Upon calling these functions with appropriate arguments, a window will appear displaying the animation. A user can find these animations, along with individual frames on their desktop (or a user specified path) under GIfgraph. All arguments are specified for each function in the following section.
        
        Please note: all testing is performed on Windows and therefore functionality may not be fully supported for Mac and Linux systems. 
        
        ## Arguments: 
        Arguments for each functioin can be found here, and also accessed within code by calling help(function). 
        
        GG_bar:
        
        	Parameters: 
                        x - x-axis data.

                        xname - x-axis name.
                        yname - y-axis name.
                        name - Title of GIF.
                        step - How many data points to be plotted per frame.
                        size - Size of GIF.
