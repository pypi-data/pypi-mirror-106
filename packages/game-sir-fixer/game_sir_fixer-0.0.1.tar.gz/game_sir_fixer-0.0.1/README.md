Long story short:

I bought this controller on Amazon because it was cheap.
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088GQY8FH

Turns out it is not great for Windows 10.
The forums I read said that this controller mis-reports its capabilites and some programs like Dolphin Emulator will not recognize some buttons.

This python program creates a virtual controller (you must have vJoystick SDK installed)

This program grabs the controller input using pygame and then emulates a press on the vJoy virtual controller.

I wrote this in a single day, so no guarentees, but me and my kids have been using it successfully all weekend.

Hope it can help someone else :-)
