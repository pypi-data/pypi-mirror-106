Description: Long story short:
        
        I bought this controller on Amazon because it was cheap.
        https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088GQY8FH
        
        Turns out it is not great for Windows 10.
        The forums I read said that this controller mis-reports its capabilites and some programs like Dolphin Emulator will not recognize some buttons.
        
        This python program creates a virtual controller (you must have vJoystick SDK installed)
        http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site/index.php/download-a-install/78-download-a-install?layout=blog
        
        This program grabs the controller input using pygame and then emulates a press on the vJoy virtual controller.
        
        I wrote this in a single day, so no guarentees, but me and my kids have been using it successfully all weekend.
        
        Hope it can help someone else :-)
