        ## What is kur.ac?
        Kur.ac is a free to use URL shortener offering various custom subdomains.
        A user can paste their URL, select a subdomain and get a shorter link.
        
        The following subdomains are offered:
        ```koji```
        ```mali```
        ```oces```
        ```veliki```
        ```volim```
        
        ## Repository
        This repository hosts an API wrapper made for this service.
        
        The wrapper was made using only the requests Python library. It works by sending a POST request to [http://www.kur.ac/_generate](http://www.kur.ac/_generate).
        
        ## Installation and usage
        In order to start shortening URLs using this package, you must first install it by running ```pip install kurac```.
        
        After the installation is complete, you may import the package by typing ```import kurac``` into your Python console or adding it to your script. You may also import it by using ```from kurac import kurac```.
        
        Finally, you may run the kurac function to generate a shortened URL. This function takes two arguments: *url* and *prefix*. The *url* argument is where you specify the link you'd like to shorten, and the prefix argument specifies the prefix to be appended. If left blank, the [kur.ac](kur.ac) service will automatically generate one.
