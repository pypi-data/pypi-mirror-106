----------

An elliptical 2D Gaussian model expressed as


.. math::

   f(x, y|A, x_0, y_0, \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \theta, b) = - A \exp\left(\frac{(x'-x'_0)^2}{2\sigma_x^2} \frac{(y'-y'_0)^2}{2\sigma_y^2}\right) + b

.. math::

   \text{with}\quad \begin{gather*}
   x' = xcos(\theta) + ysin(\theta) \\
   y' = -xsin(\theta) + ycos(\theta)
   \end{gather*}


is fitted from an effective psf. :code:`scipy.optimize.minimize` is used to minimize :math:`\chi ^2` from data. Initial parameters are found using the moments of the `effective psf <https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/epsf.html>`_. This method is 4 times faster than :code:`photutils.centroids.fit_2dgaussian` and lead to similar results.
