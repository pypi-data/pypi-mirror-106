"""Common logic for instantiating the Mycroft Skills Manager.

The Mycroft Skills Manager (MSM) does a lot of interactions with git.  The
more skills that are installed on a device, the longer these interactions
take.  This is especially true at boot time when MSM is instantiated
frequently.  To improve performance, the MSM instance is cached.

    configuration argument.  Calling this function before create_msm will
    ensure that changes to configs not related to MSM will not result in new
