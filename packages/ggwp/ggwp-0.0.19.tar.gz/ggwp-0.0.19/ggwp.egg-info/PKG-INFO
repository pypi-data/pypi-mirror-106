        ## What is ggwp?
        
        **ggwp** is a Python package for fast and easy data analytics.  
        It aims to make a data model that can be applied for some use cases  
        such as customer analytics. The data model created by ggwp is designed  
        directly from my personal experiences, which will be more and more data models  
        in the future. In addition, **ggwp** now has some new features for  
        logging, modeling and evaluating your models, which of these can speed up your workflow  
        FOR REAL!!
        
        ## Main Features  
        Here are current features available in **ggwp**
