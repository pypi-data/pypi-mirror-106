decks are not an attribute of the cards nor viseversa.
A deck is simply a tag command e.g. +spanish -math) as well as a default tagging for new cards

Example
a general deck might be programmed to exclude spanish cards, but it will not make any tags by default

Example 
a statistical biology subdeck could include all cards with those two tags, and by default tag cards with them.
