        Features
        ========
        
        - Integrates ImageMagick_ to resize images and create thumbnails.
        - Generates clean, slim, semantically appropriate HTML5 and uses
          CSS 3 for styling.  As a result, the output can easily be themed.
        - Provides HTML access keys for keyboard navigation.
        - Optimizes images to reduce size and remove metadata.
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        - Python_ 3.7+
        - Jinja_
        - ImageMagick_ (tested with 6.6.9-7)
        - jpegoptim_ (tested with 1.4.6)
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        It is recommended to create a virtual environment and run gallerize
        inside it.
        
        To install ImageMagick_, jpegoptim_, and virtualenv_ on Debian/Ubuntu:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ aptitude install imagemagick jpegoptim python-virtualenv
        
        This should also give you a copy of pip_.
        
        Create a virtual environment called `venv` in the application path:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ virtualenv venv
        
        Activate it (note the space after the first dot!):
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ . venv/bin/activate
        
        Install the dependencies of this application:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        Install gallerize itself:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ pip install -e .
        
        
        Tests
        =====
        
        Install test dependencies:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ pip install -r requirements-test.txt
        
        Run tests:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ pytest
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To create a gallery in the directory `output` from a all images in the
        directory `images`:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ gallerize output/ images/*
        
        See the usage help for more information on specifying a gallery title,
        image captions, image dimensions, and more:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ gallerize --help
