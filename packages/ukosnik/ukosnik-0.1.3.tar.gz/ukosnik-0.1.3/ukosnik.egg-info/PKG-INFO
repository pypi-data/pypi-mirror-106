        ![Insert/update demo output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Unoqwy/ukosnik/master/demo/screenshot-update.png "comamnd: ukosnik update <config> -d")
        
        ## Installation
        
        **Python 3.6 or higher is required**
        
        Run the command `python3 -m pip install -U ukosnik` to install the CLI.  
        
        You may alternatively clone the repository and install the package from local sources.
        
        ## Usage
        
        The following examples assume the environment variable `DISCORD_TOKEN` to be set.  
        
        **Register/update slash commands:**  
        
        ```sh
        # Register/update commands
        ukosnik update config_file.yml
        
        # Same but delete oudated commands
        ukosnik update config_file.yml -d
        
        # Register/update guild commands
        # (very useful for testing since cache updates instantly)
        ukosnik update config_file.yml --guild GUILD_ID
        ```
        
        Please note that updating application commands may take up to 1 hour to refresh, this is an expected Discord behavior.
        Read more about it [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands#registering-a-command).  
        **To debug commands, it's recommended to use the `--guild` argument since guild commands update instantly, unlike application-scoped commands.**
        
        *Note: Providing multiple configuration files to merge is not supported yet but is planned.*
        
        **Clear all commands:**  
        
        ```sh
        # Clear all application commands
        ukosnik clear
        
        # Clear all commands from a guild
        ukosnik clear --guild GUILD_ID
        ```
        
        ⚠️ No confirmation will be prompted before deleting commands.
        
        ## Configuration
        
        Configuration documents are pretty straighforward. They can be either a yml or json file.
        
        For now, the only available field in a configuration document is `commands`. You may provide either an object of commands with the command name as key or a simple list.  
        To get a better understanding of how you can register commands, take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/Unoqwy/ukosnik/tree/master/examples).
