        Export Datasette records as GitHub flavoured markdown
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install this plugin in the same environment as Datasette.
        
            $ datasette install datasette-gfm
        
        ## Usage
        
        Having installed this plugin, every table and query will gain a new `.md` export link.
        
        You can also construct these URLs directly: `/dbname/tablename.md`
        
        ## Demo
        
        TBD
        
        ## Development
        
        To set up this plugin locally, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:
        
            cd datasette-gfm
            python3 -mvenv venv
            source venv/bin/activate
        
        Or if you are using `pipenv`:
        
            pipenv shell
        
        Now install the dependencies and tests:
        
            pip install -e '.[test]'
        
        To run the tests:
        
            pytest
        
        ## Thanks
        
        This plugin is very heavily based on [datasette-yaml](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-yaml) by Simon Willison.
