| **.straight_amortization()** | Calculates amortization table with straight amortization and returns a dataframe. |
| **.annuity_amortization()** | Calculates amortization table with annuity payments and returns a dataframe. |
| **.to_html(method="annuity")** | Calculates amortization dataframe (methods: 'straight' or 'annuity') and returns results to a string with html markup. |
| **.to_json(method="annuity")** | Calculates amortization dataframe (methods: 'straight' or 'annuity') and returns results to a string with JSON object. |
