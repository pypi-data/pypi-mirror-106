# pyssg

Static Site Generator inspired by Roman Zolotarev's [ssg5](https://rgz.ee/bin/ssg5) and [rssg](https://rgz.ee/bin/rssg) Luke Smith's [lb and sup](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb) and, pedantic.software's [blogit](https://pedantic.software/git/blogit/).

The reason of making this in python is because I was tired of wanting (some) features from all of these minimal programs, but being a pain in the ass to maintain or add features on my own, specially to `blogit`...; making minimalist software it's great and all, but there is a limit on how pretentious and elitist a software can be for me to accept it.
