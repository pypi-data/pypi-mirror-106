        Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies”, is a paper-and-pencil game for 
        two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who 
        succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is 
        the winner [**Source**: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)].
        
        The main purpose of the project was to become accustomed with packaging projects and 
        distributing them on PyPi.  
        
        **Note**: Source code was inspired by [Tic Tac Toe Game - Python Tkinter GUI Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx0qmpuA-vM)
