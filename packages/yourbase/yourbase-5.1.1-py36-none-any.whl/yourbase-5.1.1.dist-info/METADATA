# YourBase Python Acceleration

Tests are important. For large monoliths, they're also a major source of drag
on velocity.

YourBase is a tool that traces your tests to determine which functions each
test depends on. It can later use this information to determine which tests
don't need to run because their code paths have not changed. These tests are
skipped automatically.

No configuration, setup, or babysitting required. All you need is

```sh
pip install yourbase
```

YourBase works with Python 2.7+ and Python 3.5+; using `pytest` or
`unittest`.

## Access

YourBase will work for free locally for 14 days. Please consider
[purchasing a license][yourbase.io] if you like it -- those who do generally
get more back than they spend.

A license also lets YourBase work in your CI, and synchronize its tracing
data among an arbitrary number of machines (without leaving your network).

[yourbase.io]: https://yourbase.io

## First run

After installing `yourbase`, if you are using `unittest` you must put

```python
import unittest
import yourbase

yourbase.attach(unittest)
```

in a file that runs before your tests (e.g. `tests/__init__.py`). Do not do this
step if you are using `pytest`.

Run your tests with the same command you typically use. You should see some output from YourBase similar to

```
[YB] Starting Python acceleration
```

The first run will be cold, so if you just want to see YourBase in action and
your tests are going to take a while, you can run a subset of tests. Tracing
data for the subset will be used correctly even if you later run all tests.

After the run finishes, running again will skip all tests. Modifying a
dependency will run only tests whose code paths touched the changed code.
You're YourBased! 🚀

### Installing for yourself vs. your team

If you add YourBase to your requirements file, it will work with no
configuration for your whole team. However if you want to just try it out
yourself, you can choose not to add it. Either way, YourBase will behave the
same.

### Forcing specific tests to run

You can tell YourBase to never skip specific tests with decorators:

```python
# pytest
import pytest

@pytest.mark.do_not_accelerate
def test_function():
   # ...

# unittest
import yourbase.plugins.unittest as yourbase

@yourbase.do_not_accelerate
class TestClass(unittest.TestCase):
   def test_function():
      # ...
```

The test or group will never be skipped due to unchanged dependencies. If you
are using test cohorting (below), it may still be skipped if it is not assigned
to the running shard.

We do not yet support this feature for `unittest`.

#### Synchronizing tracing data

By default, YourBase's tracing data will not leave the machine it was
gathered on without further configuration. This means CI or containerized
test runs will not be able to share tracing data forward, kneecapping
YourBase.

To solve this, YourBase can be made to share tracing data among any number of
machines using an S3 bucket as a collaboration point. To do so, all machines
should set

```sh
YOURBASE_REMOTE_CACHE=s3://<bucketname>[/key/prefix]
```

where `<bucketname>` is an S3 bucket that each machine has `Get`/`Put`/`List`
access to. Tracing data generated for passing builds from clean working trees
will be synchronized to this location, then used for future runs if a local
cache is not present.

This tracing data includes:

- test names
- file names
- class and function names
- relationships between of the above
- a small amount of metadata like commit hash, build time, and Python version

Your code base will never be uploaded to the bucket. Neither your code nor your
tracing data will touch YourBase servers.

It is safe to share one bucket between multiple repositories, even if across
multiple languages.

##### AWS credentials

We'll use the system AWS credentials by default.  This can be configured via
environment variables or [AWS CLI configuration files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).

```sh
# To use system AWS credentials via environment variables, ensure your
# credentials are exported in your environment.
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=changeme
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=changeme
```

If you're setting the system AWS credentials to bogus values for your tests 
or CI, you can set these YourBase-specific environment variables instead:

```sh
# To set YourBase specific AWS credentials, export the following:
export YOURBASE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=changeme
export YOURBASE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=changeme
```

If these are set, we'll use them instead of the system credentials.

#### Test parallelization

YourBase has first-party support for acceleration-friendly parallelization:

1. Set `YOURBASE_COHORT_COUNT` to the number of shards
2. Set `YOURBASE_ACTIVE_COHORT` to the shard ID (in the range `[1, YOURBASE_COHORT_COUNT]`)

For example, if you are using CircleCI:

```sh
export YOURBASE_COHORT_COUNT=$CIRCLE_NODE_COUNT
export YOURBASE_ACTIVE_COHORT=$(($CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX + 1))
```

YourBase uses consistent hashing to split your tests across shards such that
adding or removing tests does not shuffle tests' shard assignments. This will
give parallelized tests the full benefits of acceleration.

#### Compatibility

##### Poetry

YourBase is compatible with the packaging and dependency management tool
Poetry. Once the YourBase package is installed, simply use Poetry as
normally.

For example:

```sh
# Install the YourBase package
poetry add yourbase

# Execute tests
poetry run pytest
```

## Known issues

### Incorrectly skipped tests

If you are using `unittest` and define your own `setUp`/`tearDown` functions, be
sure they call `super` before performing other actions:

```python
class MyTestClass:
   def setUp(self):
      super(self.__class__, self).setUp()
      # ...

   def tearDown(self):
      super(self.__class__, self).tearDown()
      # ...
```

If you are not defining your own `setUp` and `tearDown` functions, you do not
need to do this.

### Errors

If you run into errors about the `_sqlite3` module not being found, first run

```sh
# Debian-based
sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
# macOS
brew install sqlite3
```

then rebuild and reinstall the Python version you are using. If you use
`pyenv`, this will look something like

```sh
pyenv install --force <PYTHON_VERSION>

# If that doesn't work, try
PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-loadable-sqlite-extensions" pyenv install --force <PYTHON_VERSION>
```

### Conflicts

#### Coverage.py's `dynamic_context` option

YourBase has a tracing conflict with one particular config setting in your `.coveragerc`:

```ini
[run]
dynamic_context = test_function
```

If this specific key is set to this specific value, YourBase will "miss" some
functions when tracing tests, causing its subsequent runs to skip tests that
should not be skipped.

You can work around this by either unsetting the option, or by enabling
YourBase's experimental line-granularity tracing, which does not conflict with
this setting:

```sh
export YOURBASE_TRACING_TYPE=line
```

Although this circumvents the issue, this tracing type is in early stages and is
less stable than function-granularity tracing (the default).

If you do not have this specific setting set in your `.coveragerc` or in
Coverage.py's command line arguments, you do not have to worry about this issue.

#### Proxy objects

Python objects that opaquely wrap other objects by overriding Python builtins
like `__name__` and `__class__` can cause tracing issues in YourBase that may
manifest as errors from within those proxy objects. If you experience these
issues, you can set

```sh
export YOURBASE_TIMID=true
```

to use a slower tracing algorithm that will avoid these errors. Tracing overhead
is dramatically increased using this flag, so we don't recommend setting this if
you are not experiencing issues.

## Contributing

This open source package is a lightweight wrapper for YourBase proprietary
code. We welcome contributions to this wrapper, but at this time we have not
built shims or mocks to allow it to be tested end to end without both pieces.

### Code style

We use [Black][black] for code formatting, which is similar in personality to
`gofmt` -- ruthless consistency, no configuration. Your build **will not pass
CI** if the Black run doesn't come back clean, so we recommend you have your
editor automatically run it on save. You can run it manually with

```sh
black .
```
