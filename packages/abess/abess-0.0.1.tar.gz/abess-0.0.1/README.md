Best-subset selection aims to find a small subset of predictors such that the resulting linear model is expected to have the most desirable prediction accuracy. This project implements a polynomial algorithm proposed by Zhu et al (2020) to solve the problem. More over, the softwares includes helpful features for high-dimensional data analysis:

- Linear regression, classification, counting-response modeling, censored-response modeling, multi-response modeling (multi-tasks learning)
- sure independence screening
- nuisance penalized regression
