## Typing stubs for click

This is an auto-generated PEP 561 type stub package for `click` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `click`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/click. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `click` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 8.0. Please uninstall the `types-click`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `a0abacdeaf23e0cc06b67040c4414f90de7d6462`.
