        ## 🚀 ProgressBar 进度条
        
        for ***loop,range,multi-threading and multi-threading with multi-params***
        
        > ___pb_range(*args)___
        
        This function is just like the python builtin function `range()`
        
        ```python
        from tykit import pb_range
        from time import sleep
        
        # use pb_range just like range()
        for i in pb_range(50):
            sleep(0.001)
        
        # or use it as a generator, with some iterabel_files
        from tykit import pb_iter
        some_task = lambda x: x*x
        iterable_file = [x for x in range(100)]
        
        for i in pb_iter(iterable_file):
            some_task(i)
        ```
        
        ![pbrange](./image/pbrange.gif)
        
        > ___pb_multi_thread(workers:int,task,iter_files)___
        
        This function intergrates the multi-threading with `ProgressBar`, which could show the master task's progress in a multi-threading script. The `param: workers` defined the max-worker of the multi-threading.
        
        ```python
        from tykit import pb_multi_thread as pbmt
        
        # Firstly, define your task func
        task_func = lambda x: x*x*x
        # Put your jobs in a iterable data structure
        jobs = [x for x in range(1000)]
        # run multi-threading with pb(ProgressBar)
        # and save the result in a list
        max_workers = 20
        result = pbmt(max_workers,task_func,jobs)
        print(result[10])
        ```
        
        > ___pb_multi_thread_partial(workers:int,task,iter_files,**kwargs)___
        
        This function is a higher api of ```pb_multi_thread()```, which is suitable for the multi-threading tasks with more than one parameters.
        
        ```python
        from tykit import pb_multi_thread_partial as pbmtp
        
        # define a task func with multi params
        def task(x,a,b,c):
            return x+a+b+c
        # Put your jobs in a iterable data structure
        jobs = [x for x in range(1000)]
        # run multi-threading with partial
        max_workers = 20
        
        result = pbmtp(max_workers,task,jobs,a=10,b=100,c=-20)
        print(result[:10])
        ```
        
        ## 🛎️ rlog (Rich-log)
        
        rlog is a module for log printing with ***rich***. It has some functions to print pretty logs and hints. The usage is simple and neat. The samples are shown below👇(for more details, you can find in [usage_of_rlog.py](https://github.com/paperplane110/tykit/blob/master/examples/usage_of_rlog.py) in examples)
