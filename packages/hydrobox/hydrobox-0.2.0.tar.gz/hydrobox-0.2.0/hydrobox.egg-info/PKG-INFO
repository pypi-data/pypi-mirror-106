Description: # HydroBox
        
        #
        **The HydroBox is mainly a toolbox used in the [V-FOR-WaTer](https://vforwater.de) Project. It will be expanded to
        serve general hydrological data exploration with a future release.**
        
        The HydroBox package is a toolbox for hydrological data analysis developed at the
        [Chair of Hydrology](https://hyd.iwg.kit.edu/english/index.php) at the
        [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://kit.edu/english/index.php).
        HydroBox has several submodules called toolboxes, which are a collection of functions and classes for specific purposes.
        As of this writing these toolboxes are:
        
        * `geostat` for geostatistics. Mainly implemented through `scikit-gstat` and `gstools`
        
        In development are:
        
        * `uncertainty_framwork` for uncertainty analysis
        * `britget` for evapotranspiration tools
