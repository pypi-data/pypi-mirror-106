Description: # Encrypter
        
        This package contains 2 main functions for Encrypting and Decrypting a file.  encrypt_file() creates an encrypted copy of a file using Fernet (symmetric encryption) in the working directory.
            The function takes a file as main argument and a key_file as optional argument. If no key_file is given, then a key for the encryption is created using Fernet.generate_key()
        
        decrypt_file() is used for decrypting the file generated by the previous function. It requires the encrypted file and the key generated (or used) during the encryption process.
