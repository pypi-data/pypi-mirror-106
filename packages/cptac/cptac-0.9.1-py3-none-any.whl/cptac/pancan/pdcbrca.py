        # NOTE: The code below will not work properly until you have all the 
        # dataframes formatted properly and loaded into the self._data
        # dictionary. That's why they're commented out for now. Go ahead and
        # uncomment them when all the data tables are ready. Note that some of
        # the lines are marked as just examples, though, and you'll still need
        # to adapt them to your specific situation.

        # ALSO: This section makes use of several useful functions from the
        # dataframe_tools.py file, such as "unionize_indices",
        # "generate_sample_status_col", and so on. If you want more information
        # about these functions, open that file and look at the docstring at
        # the beginning of each functions, which is a triple-quoted string that
        # gives an overview of what the function does, a description of what
        # each parameter should be, and a description of the returned value. If
        # you're using a function in a Jupyter Notebook or Python interpreter,
        # you can also get the docstring using the Python "help" function, which
        # just checks if the function has a docstring and then prints it if it
        # does. An example usage would be "help(reformat_normal_patient_ids)".
        # You can use the help function for any function from any library, not
        # just cptac; docstrings are a common standard.

        # Get a union of all dataframes' indices, with duplicates removed
        ###FILL: If there are any tables whose index values you don't want
        ### included in the master index, pass them to the optional 'exclude'
        ### parameter of the unionize_indices function. This was useful, for
        ### example, when some datasets' followup data files included samples
        ### from cohorts that weren't in any data tables besides the followup
        ### table, so we excluded the followup table from the master index since
        ### there wasn't any point in creating empty representative rows for
        ### those samples just because they existed in the followup table.

        # master_index = unionize_indices(self._data) 

        # Use the master index to reindex the clinical dataframe, so the clinical dataframe has a record of every sample in the dataset. Rows that didn't exist before (such as the rows for normal samples) are filled with NaN.

        # new_clinical = self._data["clinical"]
        # new_clinical = new_clinical.reindex(master_index)

        # Add a column called Sample_Tumor_Normal to the clinical dataframe indicating whether each sample was a tumor or normal sample. Use a function from dataframe_tools to generate it.

        ###FILL: Your dataset should have some way that it marks the Patient IDs
        ### of normal samples. The example code below is for a dataset that
        ### marks them by putting an 'N' at the beginning of each one. You will
        ### need to write a lambda function that takes a given Patient_ID string
        ### and returns a bool indicating whether it corresponds to a normal
        ### sample. Pass that lambda function to the 'normal_test' parameter of
        ### the  generate_sample_status_col function when you call it. See 
        ### cptac/dataframe_tools.py for further function documentation.
        ###START EXAMPLE CODE###################################################

        # sample_status_col = generate_sample_status_col(new_clinical, normal_test=lambda sample: sample[0] == 'N')

        ###END EXAMPLE CODE#####################################################

        # new_clinical.insert(0, "Sample_Tumor_Normal", sample_status_col)

        # Replace the clinical dataframe in the data dictionary with our new and improved version!
        # self._data['clinical'] = new_clinical

        # Edit the format of the Patient_IDs to have normal samples marked the same way as in other datasets. 
        
        ###FILL: You may need to use the code below to reformat the patient IDs
        ### in your dataset. This applies if all of the normal samples are
        ### already marked in the original data files in some way, but just not
        ### in the way we want (e.g. they have an "N" at the beginning of the
        ### sample ID, instead of a ".N" at the end). Be aware that the case
        ### with some datasets such as PDAC is different; instead of the normal
        ### samples already being marked, just not in the way we want, they're
        ### actually contained in a separate table, with no special marking on
        ### the sample ids. In those cases you wouldn't use the
        ### reformat_normal_patient_ids function, and would instead just mark
        ### the samples in the normal tables with the ".N" before appending them
        ### to the tumor tables.
        ### If you do use this function: the standard normal ID format is to
        ### have the string '.N' appended to the end of the normal patient IDs,
        ### e.g. the  normal patient ID corresponding to C3L-00378 would be
        ### C3L-00378.N (this way we can easily match two samples from the same
        ### patient). The example code below is for a dataset where all the
        ### normal samples have  an "N" prepended to the patient IDs. The
        ### reformat_normal_patient_ids function erases that and puts a ".N" at
        ### the end. See cptac/dataframe_tools.py for further function
        ### documentation.
        ###START EXAMPLE CODE###################################################
        # self._data = reformat_normal_patient_ids(self._data, existing_identifier="N", existing_identifier_location="start")
        ###END EXAMPLE CODE#####################################################

        # Call function from dataframe_tools.py to sort all tables first by sample status, and then by the index
        # self._data = sort_all_rows(self._data)

        # self._data = standardize_axes_names(self._data)
