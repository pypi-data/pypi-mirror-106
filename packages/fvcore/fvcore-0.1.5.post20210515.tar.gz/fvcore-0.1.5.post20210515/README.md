# fvcore

fvcore is a light-weight core library that provides the most common and essential
functionality shared in various computer vision frameworks developed in FAIR,
such as [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/),
[PySlowFast](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SlowFast)
[ClassyVision](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ClassyVision).
All components in this library are type-annotated, tested, and benchmarked.

The computer vision team in FAIR is responsible for maintaining this library.

## Features:

Besides some basic utilities, the most notable features of fvcore are:
* A hierarchical per-operator flop counting tool: see [this note for details](./docs/flop_count.md).
* Recursive parameter counting: [Doc](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/fvcore.html#fvcore.nn.parameter_count).
