        This project exists so I can play around with integrating CI/CD (and figure out
        what that actually means) into my projects, and publish documentation to
        `Read the Docs <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ automatically.
        
        I basically just want to give myself a skeleton to work from where I do things
        "the right way", so I can use that as a base for any real projects I may want
        to do in the future.
        
        Huge shout-out to Chris Billington for his amazing 
        `inotify-simple <https://github.com/chrisjbillington/inotify_simple>`_ package,
        which was part of what inspired me to do something like this in the first place.
        It's a simple, extremely useful package with great documentation. Top notch.

        ---------------
        Installation
        ---------------
        
        Installation of the fish-pen package should be as simple as running the command:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
                python3 -m pip install fish_pen
        
        and you should be up and running.
        
        I'll get around to distributing an apt package eventually probably.
        This will allow you to install the package from your local installation as well.
        This is excellent for if you for instance have packages which you don't want to
        publish on PyPI, but still want to install into a virual environment somewhere.
        If this is the case, installation will be as simple as
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
                python3 -m pip install --find-links=/usr/share/wheels fish_pen
        
        And it should work the exact same way.
        
        ---------------
        Example usage
        ---------------
        
        You can do some really cool stuff with this example package! Watch:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
                import fish_pen
        
                fish_pen.hello()
        
        Which will print `Hello world!` for you! Isn't that neat?
        
        Markdown is a little limited, so more documentation is of course available at
        `Read the docs <https://fish-pen.readthedocs.org>`_.
