Description: couchcopy
        =========
        
        Create an archive of a running CouchDB node, saving CouchDB files
        ``data/.shards``, ``data/_dbs.couch`` and ``data/shards`` in this order.
        To allow backup of a running CouchDB, files are copied before archive creation.
        
        Restore an archive of a CouchDB node to a new CouchDB. The new CouchDB can be a
        cluster of multiple nodes.
        The new CouchDB configuration should already be done before using couchcopy,
        however, all existing data will be deleted.
        During restoration, CouchDB will be stopped and restarted on each cluster
        nodes.
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        
        Tested with CouchDB 3.1.1 only.
        
        To restore an archive, couchcopy needs to stop and start CouchDB. It assumes
        that CouchDB is controlled by systemd. If you don't use systemd you can
        change parameters ``--couchdb-start="sudo systemctl start couchdb"`` and
        ``--couchdb-stop="sudo systemctl stop couchdb"``.
        
        Your CouchDB ``n`` value should be higher or equal to the number of nodes in
        your CouchDB cluster.
        Otherwise saving shards from one node would not be enough to save and restore
        all databases.
        `See CouchDB documentation for more details on replicas and nodes
        <https://docs.couchdb.org/en/3.1.1/cluster/theory.html#theory>`_
        
        The number of shards per database, i.e. the value of ``q``, should be the same
        for the origin CouchDB and the destination CouchDB.
        Otherwise, ``tree /data/shards`` is not the same.
        
        couchcopy assumes you have read access on CouchDB data folders, and read and
        write access on ``couchcopy create --rsync-reuse-folder FOLDER`` folder.
        It assumes you do not have write access on CouchDB data folders during
        restoration and thus will use ``sudo`` to write. You can use ``sudoers``
        ``timestamp_timeout`` if you don't want to re-type passwords too often.
        
        Get started
        -----------
        
        .. code:: shell
        
         pip install --user couchcopy
         couchcopy backup old-server,/var/lib/couchdb backup.tar.gz
         couchcopy restore backup.tar.gz admin:password@cluster_vm1,/var/lib/couchdb \
             admin:password@cluster_vm2,/var/lib/couchdb \
             admin:password@cluster_vm3,/var/lib/couchdb
        
        To quickly access data from a backup, by spawning a CouchDB instance:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
         couchcopy load backup.tar.gz
        
        For more options:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
         couchcopy -h
         couchcopy backup -h
         couchcopy load -h
         couchcopy restore -h
        
        On Fedora, CouchDB can be installed and configured with the following :
        
        .. code:: shell
        
         sudo dnf copr enable -y adrienverge/couchdb
         sudo dnf install couchdb
         sudo sh -c 'echo "admin = password" >> /etc/couchdb/local.ini'
         sudo systemctl restart couchdb
        
        If you work with remote machines, CouchDB needs to listen to remote IPs on
        each machine. You can enable it with the following (for security, revert it
        afterwards):
        
        .. code:: shell
        
         sudo sed -i 's/;bind_address = 127.0.0.1/bind_address = 0.0.0.0/g' /etc/couchdb/local.ini
        
        Implementation details
        ----------------------
        
        During restoration, if the new CouchDB nodes names are not the same as the
        old CouchDB, nodes names are updated using  CouchDB ``/_node/_local/_dbs``
        endpoint. See CouchDB ``/_node/_local/_dbs`` `endpoint documentation
        <https://docs.couchdb.org/en/3.1.1/cluster/sharding.html#updating-cluster-metadata-to-reflect-the-new-target-shard-s>`_.
        
        During restoration, couchcopy first updates one CouchDB node metadata (i.e. the
        list of nodes names) then it lets CouchDB itself synchronize metadata to the
        other nodes.
        couchcopy exits when the synchronization is finished for all nodes, using
        undocumented CouchDB ``/_dbs`` endpoint to monitor CouchDB nodes
        synchronization.
        You can skip that part if you want, i.e. you can exit couchcopy safely when the
        following log trace is displayed
        ``[Waiting for CouchDB cluster synchronization...]``.
        For a CouchDB of 10^5 database, updating the first node metadata takes 35 minutes,
        then metadata synchronization to the other nodes takes 6 minutes.
        For a CouchDB of 100 databases only, both operations are nearly instantaneous.
        
        Developer notes
        ---------------
        
        To speed up CouchDB nodes synchronization it is possible to:
        
        - Disable compaction daemon during synchronization (for 10^5 database, nodes
          synchronization goes from 6 minutes down to 4 minutes).
        - Copy the saved ``_dbs.couch`` on every machine, but it sounds dangerous, it
          sounds better to let CouchDB rebuild these files itself (for 10^5 database,
          nodes synchronization goes from 6 minutes down to 0 seconds).
        - Machines disk IOPS consumption is around 1200 IOPS during restoration.
        - Sometime, the nodes synchronization, instead of taking 6 minutes for 100kDB,
          takes more than 3 hours. I wasn't able to find the cause or eliminate this
          bad performance reliably. I advise using fast machines on the same local
          network, and disable compaction.
