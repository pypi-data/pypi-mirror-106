Description: # Introduction
        This python module was born after a week of experiments with the pomegranate library, that offers a nice implementation of a Markov chains (https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate), and the Beatles chords library, that contains chord annotations of the discography of the band The Beatles (the original database can be found here: http://isophonics.net/content/reference-annotations-beatles). The result is an easy to install module, that can be reused by anyone that want to experiment with automatic music composition and chord generation.
        
        ## Installation
        The package can easily be installed using the pip package manager.
        ```shell
        pip install beatles_chords_markov_chain
        ```
        
        # Notation
        In order to represent a chord progression, without being constrained to a particular scale or mode, a symbolic approach using intervals is employed.
        
        ```python
        # the roman notation is used to represent the chords of a generic mode
        chord_notation = ['I', 'II', 'III', 'IV', 'V', 'VI', 'VII']
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        The trained markov chain contained in the module, is able to generate sequences of variable lenghts. A generated sequence is a list of symbols that can be used to create interesting chord progressions based on the style of The Beatles.
        
        ```python
        from beatles_chords_markov_chain import chords_markov_chain
        number_of_chords = 6
        chords_for_your_next_song = chords_markov_chain.sample(number_of_chords)
        ```
