Description: # Spot Puppy Python Library
        This package contains code to easily get a quadruped up and running. It also contains extendable classes to allow you to write your own balancing algorithms and gaits. Have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/JoshPattman/spotpuppy/wiki) for more info 
        ## Instalation
        This library is on pip so you can use `pip install spotpuppy`
        > There are a few built in types in this library that require specific libraries to run (e.g. `mpu6050_rotation_sensor.sensor` requires the `mpu6050` package for rpi). These only have to be installed when you want to use the modules, but can be ignored if you are not using them. If a required module is not found, an `ImportError` will be thrown
        ## Usage
        Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/JoshPattman/spotpuppy/wiki) for information on usage of the library
