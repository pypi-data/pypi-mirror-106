Note
====

This is a forked version of the original `AutoAPI <https://pypi.org/project/autoapi/>`_, released under the same licensing, with updates specifically for the `Origen project <https://origen-sdk.org/>`_. The original source is available on its `Github <https://github.com/carlos-jenkins/autoapi>`_ project.

Warning
=======

As this is a re-release, many of the configuration values remain the same as the original. It is not advised to use this in parallel to the `original package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autoapi/>`_.

Introduction
============

Automatic Python API reference documentation generator for Sphinx, inspired by
Doxygen.

``Origen-AutoAPI`` (just ``AutoAPI`` going forward) is a Sphinx extension to automatically generate
API reference documentation for Python packages, recursively, without any intervention
from the developer. It will discover all the package modules and their public
objects and document them.
