Description: # testgui
        Drop-in replacement GUI for Django testing and testing with unittest.
        
        ### Usage:
        
        Django: replace your management command `test` with `testgui`. It works with the same parameters out of the box. eg.
        
            python manage.py testgui
        
        Unittest: change your test file code like this:
        
            from testgui import unittestgui
            ...
            if __name__ == '__main__':
                unittestgui.main()  # instead of unittest.main()
        
        Here's a screenshot with TestGUI in operation, after calling python manage.py testgui:

        ### Installation:
        
            pip install testgui
        
        To use with unittests you are set up.
        
        To use django management command, add testgui to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'testgui',
                ...
            ]
        
        #### Dependencies: 
        
         * [django] [only required if you want to use it as a django management command]
         * pywebview
        
         Compatible with redgreenunittest.

        ## Features:
        
        - hot module reload* (You don't need to restart testing after you've changed your code.)
        - hot test re-population (If you've changed the name of your test or added new tests, still don't need to restart testing.)
        - normal debugging (You can still use PyCharm or your favorite IDE to debug your code, just as with manage.py test.)
        - run selected test (You just click the icon next to a test or an app and your test runs, don't need to stop debugging.)
        
        *note that unfortunately models.py and admin.py files cannot be hot-reloaded by Django's design. 
        However, TestGUI warns you about this and it does not hot-reload these modules.
