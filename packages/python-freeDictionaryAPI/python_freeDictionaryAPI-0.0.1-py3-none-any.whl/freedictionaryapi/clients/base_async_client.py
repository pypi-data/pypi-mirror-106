    Base asynchronous dictionary API client.

        """
        Fetch data of the API response.

        It is a abstract method that
        must implement:

            - **asynchronous** HTTP request to the API by given url
              (url that is generated by input params in invoked function);
            - Get status code of the API response;
            - Cast API response to python object with JSON decoding (apparently it is provided in all web libraries,
              need to do something like that:
              ::

                  response: ResponseType
                  json_response: Any = await response.json()

        The most important part is
        returning - method must return tuple of:

            1. integer code of the API response;
            2. python object loaded from API response with JSON decoding.

        So:

            - integer code of the API response will be analyzed
              and correspond error will be raised
              if API returned one, so response is unsuccessful;
            - python object that expresses API response
              will be parsed, so all information will be available.

        Finally, it should look like (pseudo code below):
        ::

            # make request just with library
            response: ResponseType
            response = await weblib.get(url)
            response_status_code = response.status_code
            json_response = await response.json()

            data_to_return = (response_status_code, json_response)

            return data_to_return

        ::

            # or maybe use some client/session
            # that have been passed on initialization
            response: ResponseType
            async with self._client.get(url) as response:
                response_status_code = response.status_code
                json_response = await response.json()

            data_to_return = (response_status_code, json_response)

            return data_to_return

        It is still any question you can also see some examples
        or just implementations of ready to use clients.
