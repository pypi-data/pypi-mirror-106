# pandemy
 *pandemy* is a wrapper around *[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)* and *[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)* to easily get DataFrames in and out of databases.
 This package is for those who enjoy working with *Pandas* and SQL but do not want to learn all bells and whistles of the *SQLAlchemy* ORM. Use your existing SQL knowledge to provide text based SQL-statements to work with the databases. 

 A first version is coming soon.
