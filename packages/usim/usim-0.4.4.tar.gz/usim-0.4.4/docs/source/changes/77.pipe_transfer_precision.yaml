summary: "Pipe.transfer reliably terminates"
description: |
  The :py:meth:`usim.Pipe.transfer` could previously attempt to sleep
  for less than the resolution of the time type (usually float). This prevented
  it from finishing. The logic now has been changed so that an uninterrupted
  sleep of the desired duration is sufficient; this automatically aligns with
  the resolution of the time type.
