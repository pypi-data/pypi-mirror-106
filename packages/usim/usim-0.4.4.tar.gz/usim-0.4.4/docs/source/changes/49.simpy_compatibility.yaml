summary: "full SimPy compatibility layer"
description: |
  The :py:mod:`usim.py` packages is a drop-in replacement for the common
  :py:mod:`simpy` package. It replicates all of SimPy's simulation primitives,
  and provides an Environment with most relevant public features.

  When hosting a SimPy simulation in μSim, μSim activities and notifications are
  mapped seamlessly onto SimPy processes and events -- and vice versa. This allows
  to run, integrate and/or migrate existing SimPy simulations to μSim easily.
