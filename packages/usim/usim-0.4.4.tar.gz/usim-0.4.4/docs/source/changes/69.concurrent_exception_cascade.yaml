summary: "Concurrent exceptions may cascade through nested scopes"
description: |
  The :py:class:`usim.Concurrent` exception rejects nested BaseExceptions;
  so far excluding other Concurrent exceptions as well. This caused any
  unhandled errors in nested Scopes to crash outer Scopes, and removed
  the original traceback information as a side-effect.

  Concurrent exceptions are now allowed inside another. This makes it
  well-defined to have unhandled exceptions in nested Scopes. Note that
  the recommendation is still to handle Concurrent exceptions early, and
  propagate regular exceptions whenever possible.
