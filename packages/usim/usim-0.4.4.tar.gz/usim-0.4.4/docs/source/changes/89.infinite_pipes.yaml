summary: "Pipes allow for infinite throughput"
description: |
  For programming simplicity, it is useful to allow a :py:class:`~usim.Pipe` which
  does not throttle throughput. This allows for a "neutral element" to disable effects
  of a :py:class:`~usim.Pipe` without changing the design of a simulation. When it is
  known up-front that unlimited throughput is desired, :py:class:`~usim.UnboundedPipe`
  provides an optimal implementation for this case as well.
