        # Installation
        *MATT* is distributed as a python package called *bionf-matt*. *MATT* requires a
        [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version of 3.5 or higher.
        
        Once python and the included package manager are installed, *MATT* can be installed using the `pip` command in a
        console:
        ```
        pip install bionf-matt
        ```
        
        # Usage
        After *MATT* has been installed it can be launched using the `matt` command in a console:
        ```
        matt
        ```
        
        This will start *MATT* and open `http://localhost:5000` in the preferred browser.
        
        Once open *MATT* can be used via the GUI in the browser.
        
        Make sure to set all the needed options under the options tab and import the alignment and tree files.
        
        After a tree has been constructed or imported the tree can be viewed in the main window and under the overview tab,
        snapshots can be saved under the snapshots tab and different tree topologies can be tested under the test tab.
