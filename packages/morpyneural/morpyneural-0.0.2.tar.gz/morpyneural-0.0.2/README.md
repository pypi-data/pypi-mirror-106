# Neural Network

A small Neural Network - Multilayer Perceptron made to learn how it works.

Warning : This is not a project for production use.
I'm using this project to try to publish clean code, it's part of my learning how to manage a project, make R&D, and more.

## Using Numba
I'm learning and using the library Numba to make this project. I have multiple goal :

1. Make the project in normal python, without using the Numba lib, that's the pure learning part of how to make a Neural Network
2. Make the project with Numba and use JiT to have better performance with the CPU
3. Make the project with Numba and use CUDA to improve performance again

## Genetic algorithm
I use genetic algorithm (in a very simple way i think, i'm not a mathematician xD) to make the learning part of the Neural Network.
Back Propagation is on the way too.
