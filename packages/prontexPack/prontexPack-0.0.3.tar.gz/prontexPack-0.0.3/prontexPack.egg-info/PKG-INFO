        things. it release
        
        0.0.2 (17/06/2021)
        -------------------
        alright so basically
        i added a guide
        and more functions 
        
        0.0.3 (17/07/2021)
        -------------------
        alright so basically
        i worked on making a new experimental thing
        called Datastore
        it's just the tmpdatabase but new methods
        you can try it out if you wanna risk your sanity
        oh yeah i also changed tmpdatabase's name to tmpdatastore
        
        
        ok so heres a guide  
        
        # -SECTION 1-
        ## THE TEMPORARY DATABASE
        
        
        > so first you wanna make a dictionary named "dataList"  
        
        > add keys.  
        
        hopefully you know how.  
        
        > now at the top do ```from prontexPack import tmpDatastore```  
        
        > and do ```db = tmpDatastore(dataList, 'ur databases name here')```  
        
        now a list of things you can do  
        
        ```findByName("keyname")```  
        returns a true or false value based on if it found the keyname in the database or not  
        
        ```findByValue("keyvalue")```  
        same thing but instead of name its a value  
        
        ```add("keyname", "keyvalue")```  
        adds a key to the database  
        
        ```printall()```  
        prints all your data into the console  
        
        ```maketext()```  
        makes your data into a compact text file  
        
        
        # -SECTION 2-  
        ## THE OTHER THINGS THAT AREN'T CATEGORIZED  
        
        > do "from prontexPack import cooltext, console"  
        
        now heres a guide on cooltext  
        
        ```cooltext("text", 5)```  
        basically, this does text like  
        
        `t  
        te  
        tex  
        text`  
        
        5 times (aka for 5 iterations)  
        
        
        simple  
        
        now we do  
        CONSOLE  
        
        >so basically get a dictionary called buttons  
        
        >the values will be what the buttons print  
        
        > like this  
        >
        >> ```buttons = {"print the word happiness":"Happiness"}```  
        
        > k now do  
        >
        >> ```console(buttons, "name here")```  
        
        now yeah  
        
        just run thing  
        
        simple. 
        
        
        > As of now, the Datastore classes are wip, but have chances of taking the role of tmpDatastore. Don't try.
        >> Really dont.
        >>> I said dont.
