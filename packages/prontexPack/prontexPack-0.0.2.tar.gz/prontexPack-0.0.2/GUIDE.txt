ok so heres a guide

SECTION 1
THE TEMPORARY DATABASE


so first you wanna make a dictionary named "dataList"

add keys.

hopefully you know how.

now at the top do "from prontexPack import tempDatabase"

and do "db = tempDatabase(dataList, 'ur databases name here')"

now a list of things you can do

findByName("keyname")
returns a true or false value based on if it found the keyname in the database or not

findByValue("keyvalue")
same thing but instead of name its a value

add("keyname", "keyvalue")
adds a key to the database

printall()
prints all your data into the console

maketext()
makes your data into a compact text file


SECTION 2
THE OTHER THINGS THAT AREN'T CATEGORIZED

do "from prontexPack import cooltext, console"

now heres a guide on cooltext

cooltext("text", 5)
basically, this does text like

t
te
tex
text

5 times (aka for 5 iterations)


simple

now we do
CONSOLE

so basically get a dictionary called buttons

the values will be what the buttons print

like this

buttons = {"print the word happiness":"Happiness"}

k now do

console(buttons, "name here")

now yeah

just run thing
