Release facilitator for pop-projects.

About
=====

Pop Release is a simple tool to automate the process of creating a release.
When making POP software releases should be happening very quickly, every
few commits should justify a release.

Since releases happen so frequently, and since they should be executed in
an identical way from project to project, pop-release becomes a simple command
to update the release locally and on pypi.


What is POP?
------------

This project is built with `pop <https://pop.readthedocs.io/>`__, a Python-based
implementation of *Plugin Oriented Programming (POP)*. POP seeks to bring
together concepts and wisdom from the history of computing in new ways to solve
modern computing problems.
