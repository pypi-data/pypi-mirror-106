Description: # Stox
         A Module to predict the "close price" for the next day and give "technical analysis". It 
         uses a Neural Network and the LSTM algorithm to predict the price. It uses a technical 
         indicator algorithm developed by the Stox team for technical analysis. Check out how it works [here](https://github.com/cstox/stox/blob/main/Workings.md).
