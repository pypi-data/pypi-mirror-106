        ## Installation
        Install and update using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):
        ```sh
        $ pip install comcigan
        ```
        ## Example
        A simple example for synced version
        ```python
        from comcigan import School
        
        myschool = School("schoolname")
        # "schoolname" doesn't have to be the full name of the school.
        # comcigan-py automatically recognizes "schoolname" as a search query.
        # If there is only one school searched, an instance of that school is created.
        # If there are more than two schools searched, ValueError is raised.
        # If there is no school searched, NameError is raised.
        
        print(myschool.name)
        # This may not be the same as "schoolname".
        
        print(myschool[2][3][3][3])
        # This returns Thursday 3rd period in the 2nd grade 3rd class.
        ```
