        ## Usage
        
        ### Deploying to GitHub pages
        
        _TODO_
        
        ### Deploying to Netlify

        ### Opting out of analytics
        
        By default, splasgen sites contain a simple analytics snippet that helps us determine usage. **We explicitly opt-out of tracking
        any personally identifiable information, and only track the site's host name.** As a free and open-source product, it's important
        that we're able to measure usage of splashgen in order to continue to invest in its development.
        
        That said, you can easily opt-out of analytics tracking by adding the following code-snippet:
        
        ```python
        site.enable_splashgen_analytics = False
        ```
        
        ## Help us out! :pray:
        
        Splashgen is currently in an early alpha. If there are any missing features that you would like added please open an issue and we will add it in! This API is in flux and will receive significant improvements and changes over the next few weeks.
