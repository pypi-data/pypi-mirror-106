## Typing stubs for retry

This is an auto-generated PEP 561 type stub package for `retry` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `retry`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/retry. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

This package was generated from typeshed commit `a0abacdeaf23e0cc06b67040c4414f90de7d6462`.
