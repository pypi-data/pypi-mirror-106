        # Meet TypeDB and TypeQL
        
        TypeDB is a distributed knowledge graph: a logical database to organise large and complex networks of data as one body of knowledge. TypeDB provides the [knowledge engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_engineering) tools for developers to easily leverage the power of [Knowledge Representation and Automated Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) when building complex systems. Ultimately, TypeDB serves as the knowledge-base foundation for intelligent systems.
        
        [TypeQL](https://github.com/vaticle/typeql) is TypeDB's reasoning and analytics query language. It provides an expressive knowledge schema language through an enhanced entity-relationship model, transactional queries that perform deductive reasoning in real-time, and analytical queries* with native distributed Pregel and MapReduce algorithms. TypeQL provides a strong abstraction over low-level data constructs and complex relationships. (* analytics queries are temporarily unavailable in 2.0.0)
        
        TypeQL is distributed as an open-source technology, while TypeDB comes in two forms: TypeDB - open-source, and TypeDB Cluster - our enterprise distributed knowledge graph.
        
        ## Knowledge Schema
        
        TypeDB provides an enhanced [entity-relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity–relationship_model) schema to model complex datasets. The schema allows users to model type hierarchies, hyper-entities, hyper-relationships, and rules. The schema can be updated and extended at any time in the database lifecycle. Hyper-entities are entities with multiple instances of a given attribute, and hyper-relationships are nested relationships, cardinality-restricted relationships, or relationships between any number of entities. This enables the creation of complex knowledge models very easily and allows them to evolve flexibly.
        
        Under the hood, TypeDB has an expressive knowledge representation system based on [hypergraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph) data structures (that generalises an edge to be a set of vertices - non-binary). TypeQL is TypeDB’s reasoning (through OLTP) and analytics (through OLAP) declarative query language. 
        
        ## Logical Inference
        
        TypeDB’s query language performs logical inference through [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning) of entity types and relationships, to infer implicit facts, associations, and conclusions in real-time, during runtime of OLTP queries. The inference is performed through entity and relationship type reasoning, as well as rule-based reasoning. This allows the discovery of facts that would otherwise be too hard to find, the abstraction of complex relationships into its simpler conclusion, as well as translation of higher-level queries into the lower level and more complex data representation.
        
        ## Distributed Analytics (temporarily unavailable in 2.0.0)
        
        TypeDB’s query language performs distributed [Pregel](https://kowshik.github.io/JPregel/pregel_paper.pdf) and [MapReduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) ([BSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_synchronous_parallel)) algorithms abstracted as OLAP queries. These types of queries usually require custom development of distributed algorithms for every use case. However, TypeDB creates an abstraction of these distributed algorithms and incorporates them as part of the language API. This enables large scale computation of BSP algorithms through a declarative language without the need of implementing the algorithms.
        
        ## Higher-Level Language
        
        With the expressivity of the schema, inference through OLTP, and distributed algorithms through OLAP, TypeDB provides a strong abstraction over low-level data constructs and complicated relationships through its query language. The language provides a higher-level schema, OLTP, and OLAP query language, which makes working with complex data a lot easier. When developers can achieve more by writing less code, the productivity rate increases by orders of magnitude.
        
        ## Importing TypeQL through Maven (for Java)
        
        ```xml
        <repositories>
            <repository>
                <id>repo.vaticle.com</id>
                <url>https://repo.vaticle.com/repository/maven/</url>
            </repository>
        </repositories>
        
        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>com.vaticle.typeql</groupId>
                <artifactId>typeql-grammar</artifactId>
                <version>{version}</version>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
        ```
        
        Replace `{version}` with the version number, in which you can find the latest on [TypeQL's Maven Repository](https://repo.vaticle.com/#browse/browse:maven:com%2Fvaticle%2Ftypeql%2Ftypeql-lang). Further documentation: http://docs.vaticle.com/docs/client-api/java#typeql
        
        ## Contributions
        
        TypeDB & TypeQL has been built using various open-source Graph and Distributed Computing frameworks throughout its evolution. Today TypeDB & TypeQL is built using [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org), [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org), [SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org), [Bazel](https://bazel.build), [GRPC](https://grpc.io), and [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org), and [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine). In the past, TypeDB was enabled by various open-source technologies and communities that we are hugely thankful to: [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org), [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org), [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org), [Apache TinkerPop](http://tinkerpop.apache.org), and [JanusGraph](http://janusgraph.org). Thank you!
