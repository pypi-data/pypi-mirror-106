Simple http handler for [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) util. I liked the idea of putting
[black[d]](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/blackd.html) into my docker compose file and using
[BlackConnect](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14321-blackconnect) plugin for auto sort without setting up my dev
env every time, but I was still missing sort formatting tool, that would work the same way. So its here... Mb I'll
release [IsortConnect](https://github.com/urm8/IsortConnect) and it will be more usable.

## install

```
poetry add isortd
```

or

```
python -m pip install --upgrade isortd
```

## usage

I'd suggest you to run this [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/urm8/isortd) with something like:

```
docker run -d --name isortd --publish "47393:47393" urm8/isortd:latest
```

or just add it to your local docker-compose file \_0_/

## todo

* socket support
* some kind of filechangelistener daemon runnable from directory
