# ðŸ—‚ forg
Simple Folder organization in python. Based on Kalle Hallden snippet

## How It Works
Go to the folder you want to organize, and in comand line, exxecute:
 ```sh
   forg
   ```
 It creates a folder called forg on the folder from where you called the command , and based in a list of file extension, it creates subfolders in forg and move files there categorizing them by type.
