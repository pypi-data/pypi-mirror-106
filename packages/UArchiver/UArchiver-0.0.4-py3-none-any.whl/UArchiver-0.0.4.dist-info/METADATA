Ultimate Archiver -- A modular archiving tool

------------------------------------------------

Ultimate Archiver (UArchiver for short) is a modular, all-in-one autoamted archiving tool. Rather than needing to keep track of several tools for downloading from different sites, this tool aims to unify them all under a single tool. Downloading is instead performed using "downloading kernels", which provide a standard interface for downloading from different domains by either using or replacing these external tools. These kernels can be selected automatically based on the site you're downloading from. **The end-goal is that you should be able to download from a site without needing to know how.**
