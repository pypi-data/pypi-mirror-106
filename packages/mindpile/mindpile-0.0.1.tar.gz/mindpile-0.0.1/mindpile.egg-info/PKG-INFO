Description: # mindpile
        
        A transpiler for EV3 Mindstorms to ev3dev2 Python.
        
        Using mypy for types and black for code-auto-formatting.
        
        ## Using
        
        [ev3sim](https://github.com/MelbourneHighSchoolRobotics/ev3sim) includes native mindpile support, this is the easiest way to get started.

        ## Blocks Partially Implemented
        
        - Display: Doesn't support displaying images, white colour, or text size
        - Sound: Doesn't support playing files, repeat play type, or stopping sounds
        - Loop Interrupt: Only supports breaking out of a loop it is directly inside. It can't break out more than 1 layer
        - Brick Buttons: This probably has some bugs
        - Motor Sensors: You must use a motor from that port before reading the value
        - Comment: Comments aren't inserted into Python code
