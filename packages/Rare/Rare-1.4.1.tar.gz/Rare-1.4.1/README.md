## Installation

### Installation via pip (recommend)

Execute `pip install Rare` for all users Or `pip install Rare --user` for only one user. Then execute `rare` in your terminal or cmd

**Note**: On Linux must be `/home/user/.local/bin` in PATH and on Windows must be `PythonInstallationDirectory\Scripts` in PATH. 

### Windows Simple

Download Rare.exe from the [releases page](https://github.com/Dummerle/Rare/releases) and execute it. 

**Note:**
Using the exe file could cause errors with Windows Defender or other Anti Virus. Sometimes it is not possible to download games and sometimes the app crashes. In this case please use pip

### Linux

#### Arch based

There are some AUR packages available:
 - [rare](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rare) - for stable releases
 - [rare-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rare-git) - for the latest features, which are not in a stable release

#### Debian based

There is a `.deb` package available from the [releases page](https://github.com/Dummerle/Rare/releases): `sudo dpkg â€“i Rare.deb`

#### Other

Install via `pip`.

## Run from source
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get dependencies. If you use `pacman` you can run `sudo pacman --needed -S python-wheel python-setuptools python-pyqt5 python-qtawesome python-requests python-pillow`
2. For unix operating systems run `sh start.sh`. For windows run `set PYTHONPATH=%CD% && python rare`

## Why Rare?

- Rare only uses ~50MB of RAM which is much less than the electron based [HeroicGamesLauncher](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher) uses.
- Rare supports all major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac) unlike the alternatives. 
  
**Note** Mac should work too, but I have no Mac and I can't test it.
