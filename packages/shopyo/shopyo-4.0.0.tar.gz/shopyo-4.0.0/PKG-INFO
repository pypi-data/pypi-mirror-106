        # What?
        
        Your next-level modular web framework. Headless support coming soon. 
        
        Built on top of Flask, it offers most Django features, sometimes a tidbit more with far more flexibility.
        
        It ships with common business needs by default
        
        # Have a go!
        
        `pip install shopyo`
        
        then
        ```
        shopyo new blog
        cd blog/blog
        python manage.py initialise
        python manage.py rundebug
        ```
        
        It is recommended to use a venv in root folder. 
        
        `python -m venv venv`
        
        If for dev install dev_requirements.txt also. 
        
        `python -m pip install -r dev_requirements.txt`
        
        go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/dashboard with credentials admin@domain.com / pass

        # First time contributing?
        
        We have a 100% first-timers friendly policy. Check out the [testimonials](https://github.com/Abdur-rahmaanJ/shopyo/discussions/307).
        
        # Big??
        
        Powered by apps / modules. Add as many as you like. 
        
        Apps are not enough, organise them in boxes and get the ultimate order you need.
        
        You need a customised Django? This is the project. You need to build an ERP? This is the project.
        
        # Linux??
        
        Hackable to the core. Even the dashboard is but a module.
        
        Don't need our modules? Nuke them. Look boring? modify them
        
        # Reliable?
        
        We don't maintain middlewares. We rely on battle tested batteries like:
        
        - flask_sqlalchemy
        - flask_login & co
        
        Heck remove them if you don't want. Want to use Peewee? You can.
        
        # Rich Flask API
        
        Common flask patterns are integrated, the structure is over the moon.
        
        Common flask tasks are provided with an API: custom notifications, bulk form errors
        
        # Back office feel & Theme
        
        All looks are 100% customisable with themes ~ Backend, bootstrap included by default.
        
        Again blow it up & use what you want. It's possible
        
        # Transparent: Code your own web distro
        
        Everything is clear, not hidden. You can 100% customise whatever you want.
        
        We did not hardcode our choices. Our APIS are incremental. You can always use barebones.
        
        # Plug & Play
        
        The modules are put by copy paste. No blueprint codes to write.
