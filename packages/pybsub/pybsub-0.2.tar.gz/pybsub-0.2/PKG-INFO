        ps = PubSub()
        
        # the channel we will subscribe to
        c = "test"
        # the callback function that will be fired
        # when a message has been published on the
        # channel we subscribed to
        cb = lambda msg: print(msg)
        
        # various ways of subscribing to a channel
        # note that it returns an integer
        # you will want to save this if you want to
        # remove the callback later on
        k = ps.subscribe(c, cb)
        # or 
        k = ps.sub(c, cb)
        # or
        k = ps.s(c, cb)
        
        # various ways of publishing
        ps.publish(c, "somedata")
        # or
        ps.pub(c, {"some": "data"})
        # or
        ps.p(c, b"somedata")
        
        # various ways of unsubscribing
        # we will use the integer we received from
        # subscribing here again
        ps.unsubscribe(c, k)
        # or
        ps.unsub(c, k)
        # or 
        ps.u(c, k)
        
        # you could also just clear all subscriptions
        ps.clear()
        
        # or you could clear all subscriptions on a channel
        ps.clear_channel()
        ```
