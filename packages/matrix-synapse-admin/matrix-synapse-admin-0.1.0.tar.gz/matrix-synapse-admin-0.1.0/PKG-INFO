Description: # Synapse-admin-api-python
        A Python wrapper for Matrix Synapse admin API
        
        This library is now support up to Synapse 1.25.0, any Admin API introduced after 1.25.0 may not be included in this version. However, newer chnages of Admin API are planned to be included in this library. For planned update, see [TODO.md](TODO.md). In the future, the version numbering convention will follow the version this library up to, for example, if this library is support up to 1.26.0, then the version number of this library will be 1.26.0.
